# Hello Dart

Welcome to the **Hello Dart** project! This repository contains code and examples from my journey learning the Dart programming language. I'm taking a course to dive deep into Dart, exploring its basics as well as more advanced concepts.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate my understanding of Dart. Throughout this course, I will cover:

- **Dart Basics**: Understanding variables (`var`), data types, and basic syntax.
- **Control Flow**: Using `if` statements, `for` loops, `while` loops, and other control flow structures.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Diving deep into OOP concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Topics Covered

1. **Variables and Data Types**: Learn how to declare and use variables in Dart, including different data types like `int`, `double`, `String`, and `bool`.
2. **Control Flow**: Explore how to control the flow of the program using conditional statements (`if`, `else if`, `else`) and loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`).
3. **Functions**: Understand how to define and use functions in Dart, including parameters, return types, and anonymous functions.
4. **Object-Oriented Programming**:
    - Classes and Objects
    - Constructors
    - Inheritance
    - Polymorphism
    - Encapsulation

## How to Use

To run the examples in this project, ensure you have Dart installed on your machine. You can clone this repository and run the Dart files using the Dart command-line interface.

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/hellodart.git](https://github.com/MohamedElgohary88/HelloDart.git)
cd hello-dart
dart filename.dart
