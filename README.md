# Hello Dart

Welcome to the **Hello Dart** project! This repository contains code and examples from my journey learning the Dart programming language. I'm taking a course to dive deep into Dart, exploring its basics as well as more advanced concepts.

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate my understanding of Dart. Throughout this course, I will cover:

- **Dart Basics**: Understanding variables, data types, constants, operators, and more.
- **Control Flow**: Using conditional statements, loops, and control flow operators.
- **Functions**: Defining and using functions, including advanced function concepts.
- **Collections**: Working with lists, sets, and maps.
- **String Manipulation**: Interpolating and manipulating strings.
- **Exception Handling**: Managing errors and exceptions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Exploring classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.

## Topics Covered

1. **Dart Basics**:
   - Variables and Data Types: `int`, `double`, `String`, `bool`, `List`, `Map`, `Set`
   - Constants: `const` and `final`
   - Operators:
     - Arithmetic (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
     - Assignment (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.)
     - Comparison (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`)
     - Logical (`&&`, `||`, `!`)
     - Bitwise and Shift Operators

2. **Control Flow**:
   - Conditional Statements:
     - `if`, `else if`, `else`
     - Ternary operator (`condition ? expr1 : expr2`)
     - `switch` and `case` statements
   - Loops:
     - `for` loop
     - `while` loop
     - `do-while` loop
     - `forEach` loop (for collections)
   - Break and Continue
   - Assert (for debugging)

3. **Functions**:
   - Defining Functions
   - Function Parameters and Return Types
   - Optional Parameters (`[param]` and `{param}`)
   - Named Parameters
   - Anonymous Functions (Lambdas)
   - Arrow Functions (Short syntax for one-liner functions)
   - Higher-Order Functions
   - Closures

4. **Collections**:
   - Lists:
     - Fixed-length vs Growable Lists
     - List Methods (`add`, `remove`, `map`, `reduce`, `filter`, etc.)
   - Sets:
     - Unique Element Collections
   - Maps:
     - Key-Value Pairs
     - Adding, Removing, and Accessing Elements
   - Iterating Collections:
     - Using Loops and `forEach`

5. **String Manipulation**:
   - String Interpolation
   - Multi-line Strings
   - String Methods:
     - `split`, `substring`, `replaceAll`, `trim`, etc.
   - Regular Expressions (RegExp)

6. **Exception Handling**:
   - `try-catch-finally`
   - Throwing Exceptions
   - Custom Exceptions

7. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**:
   - Classes and Objects:
     - Defining Classes and Creating Objects
     - Instance Variables and Methods
   - Constructors:
     - Default, Named, and Factory Constructors
     - Constructor Chaining
   - Inheritance:
     - `extends` Keyword
     - Method Overriding
   - Polymorphism:
     - Upcasting and Downcasting
   - Encapsulation:
     - Private Members (`_variableName`)
     - Getters and Setters
   - Abstract Classes and Interfaces:
     - Abstract Methods
     - Implementing Interfaces
   - Mixins
   - Static Members:
     - Static Variables and Methods

## How to Use

To run the examples in this project, ensure you have Dart installed on your machine. You can clone this repository and run the Dart files using the Dart command-line interface.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamedElgohary88/HelloDart.git
cd HelloDart
dart filename.dart
